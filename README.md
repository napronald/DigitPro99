# DigitPro99

Welcome to DigitPro99, a project dedicated to digit recognition. The goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately classifying digits from 0 to 99, with plans to expand its capabilities in the future.

## Current State

As of now, DigitPro99 can successfully classify digits from 0 to 9. You can see the model in action by visiting https://napronald.github.io/DigitPro99/

## Ongoing Development

Currently, the focus is on **the classification and detection of multiple digits**.
Next, I will work on deploying a larger model via an API for digit segmentation.

## Future Plans

Over the coming weeks,

- Add instructions
- Make more appealing
- Visualization of Statistics. Radar chart?
- Incremental Learning/Zero Shot Learning?
- Finalize and deploy the larger model through API.
- Expand the model's classification capabilities beyond the basic 0-9 digits.
- Explore additional features and improvements to further enhance the model's performance.

Thank you for your interest!
